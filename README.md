# Project-University-Mental-Health
Conducting data analysis to identify students who are at risk of mental health issues. This project consists of 4 parts:
1. Acquiring data on mental health of foreign students in Japan
2. Perform exploratory data analysis and test a few hypotheses
3. Transform the data for machine learning
4. Train a machine learning model based on several hypotheses

The dataset we are working with comes from the research of Nguyen et al (2019), where the authors obtained a record of 268 questionaire results of depression, acculturative stress, social connectedness, and help-seeking behaviour by a cohort of local and international students.
